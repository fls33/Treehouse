    <!--Notice that when you view our code in chrome developer tools to see what it looks like in different device, notice how the media queries have not taken affect yet. So it's displaying the normal layout. Not the one optimized for smaller screens. So our layout look likes it would look on a desktop browser, but much smaller. So the content is a little difficult to read or see. This is happening because modern devices, like iphone for example, use a vitual viewport that zooms out as much as it can so that the entire layout fits on a screen.-->
    
    <!--So to optimize our layout for mobile devices, we'll need to add a special HTML meta tag that instructs to device how to handle the viewport size on mobile devices.-->
    
    <meta name="viewport" content ="width=device-width"> <!--What we did here is we added a meta tag and we added a attribute called name and set the value to viewport. Right after that we added another attribute called content and we set the value to width=device-width. So in this content value here the width property is what controls the size of the device viewport. And with the value device-width the device's browser will zoom in to fit the screen as much as it needs to, according to the device's width.-->

				Unspoiled beaches with ivory sand and clear waters, a warm people, verdant seaweed farms and delectable coconut crabs. These make the Caluya group of islands rich.
        
        The absence of high-rises further makes the islands a perfect getaway for nature trippers who want a respite from the pains of city life. There, they can go snorkeling diving, boating or swimming alongside playful dolphins.

        <h3>Caluya Island Delicacies</h3>
       
        
        <ol>
          <li>Coconut Crab locally known as "Tatus": "This crab eats leaves, rotting fruits, small animals and turtle eggs but it thrives on coconut, thus it name," Ms. Arrido said. Tatus can grow up to 40 centimeters, weight up to four kilograms and live for more than 30 years. These elusive crustaceans are hunted at night when they forage for food. Hunters use flashlights and grilled coconut as bait.</li>
          <img src="img/crab.jpg" alt="crab">
          <li>Sea Urchins locally known as "Tirik" is another exotic delicacy of Caluya: The "tirik" is a favorite local delicacy. An orange colored meat is revealed after opening a sea urchin. You can just eat the meat by scraping it with your fingers. It was just slimy at first but then had an after taste of salty and sweet flavors. The spikes do not sting so you can pick them up with your bare hands. The sea urchins are scattered a few feet from the shore and there's so many of them that you can probably collect a whole sack in less than an hour. They had different ways of cooking tirik like "grilled" and "adobo na tirik". Both of them tatsted great but eating it raw and fresh from the sea was my favorite. </li>
