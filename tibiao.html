          <li>Lambaklad fishing is one of the largest fish traps in the country. It is located in Brgy. Malabor, approximately 3 km. from town proper. Lambaklad is derived by fusing the dialect, "lambat" or net and "baklad" or fish corral, hence "lambat-baklad" or in short "lambaklad". 
            
            It consist of four main parts: the leader, playground, the inner and outer slopes, and the bag. The leader blocks the path of the school of migratory fish that lead them to the playgorund. From the playground, the fish enters to the outer slope by means of the pointed nettings. As the fish passes through the slope, it enters to the inner slope or non-return valve dropping into the bag where they are trapped and hauled for the catch.
            
            Tibiao has a good fishing ground and it is believed to be the highway of migratory fishes. Having a productive waters, Tibiao produces commercial species of pelagic and migratory fishes such as tuna-like species, caranx, marlins, Spanish mackerels or tangigue, barracuda, swordfishs, cavallas, red tails scads, and sardines.

Rappelling to this fall is like climbing a stairway while holding the big rope. For first timers, local guides will be assisting you for the climb. Just take one step at a time because the stones are slippery.
