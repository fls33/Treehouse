    <!--Notice that when you view our code in chrome developer tools to see what it looks like in different device, notice how the media queries have not taken affect yet. So it's displaying the normal layout. Not the one optimized for smaller screens. So our layout look likes it would look on a desktop browser, but much smaller. So the content is a little difficult to read or see. This is happening because modern devices, like iphone for example, use a vitual viewport that zooms out as much as it can so that the entire layout fits on a screen.-->
    
    <!--So to optimize our layout for mobile devices, we'll need to add a special HTML meta tag that instructs to device how to handle the viewport size on mobile devices.-->
    
    <meta name="viewport" content ="width=device-width"> <!--What we did here is we added a meta tag and we added a attribute called name and set the value to viewport. Right after that we added another attribute called content and we set the value to width=device-width. So in this content value here the width property is what controls the size of the device viewport. And with the value device-width the device's browser will zoom in to fit the screen as much as it needs to, according to the device's width.-->

			<p class="intro">
				Sebaste, Antique(207KM) is a unprepossessing jewel of a community. While Sebaste is the locationof Igpasungaw Falls and certainly other attractions, for me the charm was more pervasive. While the Municipal Building is just off the National Highway, the church and plaza are well off the highway forming a clean, unspoiled and peaceful center to the town. It's only steps from the church to the sea. The entire tableau was charming. When I was there the church plaza was filled with school children. The streets and plaza were clean and well kept.

        These stunning works of Mother Nature speak volumes of beauty, allure, and power. They are venues for heart-stopping adventures, sanctuaries for serenity, and sources for a land's commerce and survival. Thus, when we knew that one of our destinations during our Experience Antique familiarization tour is the magnificient Igpasungaw Falls in the municipality of Sebaste, our hearts beat with excitement and delight.

        <h3>Mountains and Expansive Rice Fields</h3>
          
           <ol>
          <li>Sebaste, like the rest of Antique, is incredibly green and unspoiled. Check out those lovely mountains, expansive rice fields, and thick woods. No wonder the air here is cool and refreshing</li>
             
             <img src="img/river.jpg" alt="River">
          <li>The sound of a powerful river serenaded us as we continued hiking the easy trail. Isn't that gorgeous? With the heat becoming more intense by the minute, we found it very hard to resist the temptation to simply jump into the clean water. This river we failed to ask the guides what its name is seems to be the source of patable water in Sebaste due to the presence of large pipes and humming pumps.</li>

          <li>We were intrigued and concerned when we saw a sign that said "Washing Area." We truly hope that no one actually washes clothes here. Not only is the area dangerous for washing, but laundering clothes here can also severly damage the river. Detergents are polluntants that can produce an overabundance of algae, which suffocates the river.</li>

          <li>When we arrived at Igpatuyaw, the entire sitio was quite as people went inside their homes tp watch noontime shows and take refuge from the noon sun's heat. This old woman however snubbed the onslaught of the fiery ball in the sky while tending to rice gains being dried under the sun. Once completely dried, the grains are then taken to the mill.</li>
